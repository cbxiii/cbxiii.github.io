## How do you estimate effort?

For my final project in my ICS314 Software Engineering class, my group and I had to estimate the amount of “effort” it would take to accomplish each issue in GitHub. In order to estimate effort, my team and I utilized the GitHub Project Board (link to most recent milestone project board). For each issue, we tracked estimated coding time, actual coding time, and actual non-coding time. Before each issue that I worked on, I would put a number for how much time I think I would spend on it. After completing that issue, I would put the actual time I spent coding for it, and also how much time I took for non-coding activities to solve the issue (i.e. reading documentation, looking at Stack Overflow to resolve bugs).


## My thoughts on effort estimation

I think that I benefitted from estimating effort for each issue. Although some of my effort estimations were inaccurate, I think that the estimations helped me become more focused on completing the issue at hand within the amount of time that I estimated. Gauging how long an issue would take helped my team and I decide whether or not to prioritize working on it. For the most part, we worked on the issues that took a longer time to complete than ones that wouldn’t take as long. Without effort estimation, I’m not sure the work would be prioritized in that manner. 


## Final reflection

I found effort estimation to be more beneficial than not. I think that I would like to use it in some way, shape, or form in future software projects that I work on. Based on the final project, I think that I would change the metrics we used in order to reflect the number of hours that were used instead of days or fractions of days. Other than that, I think that effort estimation is a good method to ensure you’re on the right track and focusing on the task at hand.
