For this project, my club was tasked with building an updated website for Farrington High Schoolâ€™s Leo Club. The website had to show a landing page with general information about Leo Club, upcoming club events, members of the club, and different contacts to reach the club at. The site also needed to support giving signed-in users the ability to add, edit, and delete club events and members. 

I worked on this project with two other software members in 8bit. I mainly contributed by creating the navbar, the landing page, and implementing CRUD functionality on the club events page. I also had to make sure that CRUD abilities were only given to signed-in users. This means that only signed-in users can add, edit, and delete events on the site. 

I learned a lot from working on this project, particularly involving implementing CRUD features in React. I also gained more experience with coding in a collaborative environment, and working on a coding project with people at the same time using Git and GitHub.
