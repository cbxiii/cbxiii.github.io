This project was my final project for ICS314, my software engineering course. For the final project, my team and I had to build a website where University of Hawaii Manoa students could find Registered Independent Organizations (RIOs) based on what type of club they're interested in (i.e. Academic, Religious). With this website, students can login with their UH email address and see every RIO offered at the university, and bookmark the ones that they're interested in.

I worked on RIBows with four other peers in my class (<a href="https://ri-bows.vercel.app/about">If you want to see everyone I worked with!</a>). I contributed to this project by working on both the frontend and backend of the website. For the frontend, I designed and implemented multiple pages on the site, such as the Edit Profile page, Bookmarked RIOs page, and the About Us page. For the backend, I created the database for the website, linked it to the project, and created the RIO model with Prisma. The tech stack we used for this project was React with TypeScript on the frontend, Next.js and Prisma ORM on the backend, and Neon PostgreSQL for the database.

This project taught me a lot about the software development process, especially about agile development. I also learned about database management and database actions, which I previously didn't have experience with until RIBows.
