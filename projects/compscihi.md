For this project, my club had to build a website that showed local job and internship postings to UH Manoa students. With this website, students could sign in and see a list of posted job opportunities. Students could sort based on categories such as when it was posted, what kind of work they're looking for, etc.

I worked on this project with six other software members in 8bit. I contributed to the project by creating the navbar, the 404 page, and other React components and pages. I also implemented the "Forgot Password" page on the website, which used React hooks keep track of a user inputting their email address.

I learned a lot from working on this project, from how to design and implement React components, to using React hooks. I also gained experience with coding in a collaborative environment, and working with multiple people in the same codebase.
