For this project, my club had to build a website that showed job and internship postings for UH Manoa students. 

I worked on this project with two other software members in 8bit. I mainly contributed by creating the navbar, the landing page, and implementing CRUD functionality on the club events page. I also had to make sure that CRUD abilities were only given to signed-in users. This means that only signed-in users can add, edit, and delete events on the site. 

I learned a lot from working on this project, particularly involving implementing CRUD features in React. I also gained more experience with coding in a collaborative environment, and working on a coding project with people at the same time using Git and GitHub.
